        <h1>Tester 1</h1>
        <p>Tester visits the menu page first. Uses the footer. Reads all pages and clicks all links.
            Task: Fill out the survey. Tester found the survey quickly via the footer. Found confusion with the togglable buttons and the color to determine which one was selected. There was no difficulty or frustrating in finding it.
            Feedback: Space to write feedback on the survey. Add logo to the front page. 
        </p>
        <h1>Tester 2</h1>
        <p>Tester takes time to slowly read the home page. Visits the menu page first via the footer. Reading all pages and clicks on all links.
            Task: Fill out the survey. Tester found the survey quickly via the footer. Did not have any frustration filling out the survey.
            Feedback: Go back button is confusing. The text should have a better font. The links at the bottom changing makes it hard to navigate.
